# Pomodoro App
"The Pomodoro Technique", the famous book/technique by Francesco Cirillo that helps people time-manage and to get more stuffs done.


## What I learned:
+ how to build a Pomodoro GUI Application completely from scratch using TKinter
+ knowledge of Dynamic Typing in Python 
+ knowledge of function arguments, default arguments, *args, and **kwargs



###### This is how app looks like:

###### The idea of The Pomodoro Technique :
+ First --> Decide on the task to be done.
+ Second --> Set the timer to 25 minutes.
+ Third --> Work on the task until the timer rings.
+ Fourth --> Take a short 5 minutes break.
+ Fifth --> Repeat 4 times from 1st to 4th.
+ Last but not least --> Take a 15-30 minute break.

###### How the app works:
> Work-in-Progress
